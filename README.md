# Analysis scripts for "perturbational phenotyping of human blood cells reveals genetically determined latent traits associated with subsets of common diseases"

<!--- This repository contains scripts for custom analyses used in [paper][website_link]. --->
GWAS summary statistics are available at the [GWAS Catalog][https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ ] (GCST90257015-GCST90257105). UKBB PGS are available at [Figshare][https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24354235]

Scripts in this repository include:
- preprocessing and QC of blood-response phenotypes for GWAS
- clumping and plotting of GWAS results
- association of blood readouts with clinical outcomes in the screening cohort
- use of blood-PGS in time-to-event models to identify associated outcomes in UKBB
- functions to visualize cytometry readouts (single samples, aggregate counts or comparisons between groups)
